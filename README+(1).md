## Problem Statement

BoomBikes, A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. The company has suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. With this model, the company wants to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market.

#### Main objective:
The company wants to know:

- Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
- How well those variables describe the bike demands

## Steps followed

1. Reading and understanding the data
2. EDA
3. Prepare the data for modelling
4. Training the model
5. Residual analysis
6. Predictions and evaluation on the test set

## Conclusions

- There would be less bookings during Light Snow or Rain, they could probably use this time to service the bikes without having business impact.
- Company should focus on expanding business during September.
- Comparing the previous data, the demand increases when the situation is back to normal
- During spring season, the sales goes down by -0.1096
